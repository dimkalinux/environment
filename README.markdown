What is this?
=============

This repository contains my portable environment. The contents include 
configuration files, documentation, utility scripts, and anything else that
I need to be consistent across environments.

`bin` utility scripts and binaries.

`doc` documentation, notes, etc.

`share` program configuration files, plugins, and resources.

`src` source for commonly used programs. kept here to make setting up a portable
environment easier if a package manager is unavailable.
